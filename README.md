# my-app

## What do I get by default ?

Nothing fancy. Just a default next.js project with tailwind and typescript.

Two things are added :
- *types/env-types.ts* that provides type safety for the process.env variables.
- a *not-found.tsx* page for you to customize.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
